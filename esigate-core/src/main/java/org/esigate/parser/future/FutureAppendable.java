 * This interface is similar to Appendable except that it is based on Future objects.

 * This allows to provide the content of the CharSequence to append at the very last moment, when all the CharSequences
 * are effectively appended together.

 * While this interface allows concurrent implementation of an Appendable (based on Future), implementations are not
 * required to be Thread-safe. This means that {@link #enqueueAppend(Future)}, {@link #performAppends()} and
 * {@link #hasPending()} are supposed to be called for the same Thread.
 * <p>
 * Management of Threads concurrency must be implemented by the Future implementation which must perform all the
 * synchronization work between any background Thread and the calling Thread.
